    <h3>Overview</h3>
</div>
  <div class="column-xs-12 column-md-6">
<p>This project starts with a small task for a company to redesign the online education and ends with a personal project to redistribute learning.Everyone started learning from childhood and it will last for the whole life. But how to collect learning information and how to consume the knowledge well is still a question for the most of people. With two-year in information school, I saw a different vision towards how to master knowledge.</p>

    <h3>Research</h3>
</div>

  <div class="column-xs-12 column-md-6">

<p>
  Research starts from the competitive product like coursera,MOOC,edX and go deeper into the essence of learning. Education is understood as a form of learning knowledge and skill. In old history, education starts from talking and discussion between a teacher and a group of students. In order to fulfill the needs of society development, education has come to a standardized product with discipline, a group of students and a teacher. Examination is one of the evaluation methods to test the qualification of a student. In modern society, only in Ph.D. degree, there exists one to one relationship between student and teacher. From primary school to graduate study, one to many relationships is the mainstream of education format. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this format ? What is the best method to learn ?</p>

    <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
</div>

  <div class="column-xs-12 column-md-6">

<p> What is the difference between old schooling and modern schooling ? What does the new technology influence the education method ? The widespread use of the Internet reconstructs the education format. It reorganized the great education method in the world. In the meantime, students are not satisfied with onsite learning due to the restriction of discipline. Besides, it is hard for everyone to catch up with the knowledge update during the school day or in the workplace. Therefore, online learning is emerging. Before diving into the history of online learning, first answering the question I mentioned aforementioned.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
</div>

  <div class="column-xs-12 column-md-6">

<p> After investigation,it is time to narrow down several questions into main question and support question.We need to focus on the primary questions and use analysis and research process to answer these questions.</p>
<p>The negative factors affecting the students online learning experience: poor internet connection, inadequate technical support, challenges in the use of e-learning, lack of pedagogical support and lack of social reinforcement</p>
<p>It should be communication with teachers and virtual classmates, a sense of belonging to the community, self-confidence, self-management, increase the easy use of online learning system and motivation.</p>
